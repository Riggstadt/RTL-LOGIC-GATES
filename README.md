# RTL-LOGIC-GATES
Resistor-Transistor Logic based Logic Gates


The purpose of this project is building logic gates out of readily available components without using any ICs. The Logic Gates are built out of discrete components and mirror the structure and behaviour of classical Resistor Transistor Gates.

### Timeline of the Project and Design Stages

1.  Researching the basic operating principles of RTL Logic
2.  Basic computer aided circuit analysis for RTL Logic Gates
    * Building and analysing the circuit of a NPN transistor switch
    * Building and analysing the circuit of a NPN transistor inverter gate
    * -/- NAND gate
    *
